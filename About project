Online Sales Dataset Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large-scale online sales dataset using Python. The goal is to extract meaningful insights into customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and regional sales trends through data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


📊 Key Features

✔️ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:

Handled missing values and duplicate records.

Standardized data formats and removed inconsistencies.


✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified top-selling products and revenue trends.

Analyzed customer behavior and purchase frequency.

Evaluated regional sales distribution and category-wise performance.


✔️ Data Visualization:

Bar charts for top-selling products.

Pie charts for revenue contributions by category.

Geographical heatmaps for regional sales trends.
